    <p>Juggernog Soda will greatly add to your physical robustness. To craft a Juggernog Cola, you will need the following ingredients:</p>
    <li>Carbonated Milk</li>
    <li>Powdered Crocodile Eggs</li>
    <li>Spinach Juice</li>
    <li>Pure Gumption, Fortified with Iron</li>  
<p>The ratio is not important at all. All that matters is that all ingredients are mixed together simultanously and 
    then pasturized for a full 24 hours. Keep refrigerated at all times! Lack of refrigeration can lead 
    to adverse effects for which we will not be held accountable. Good luck out there!
